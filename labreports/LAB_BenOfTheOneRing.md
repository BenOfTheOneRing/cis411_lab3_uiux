### Captions and steps: 
![LinkidIn](1.png)
I already had a LinkedIn account before this lab. 

I navigated to my main page [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-clarke-88554a260/) using a bookmark on Chrome. 

![LinkidIn](2.png) 
I clicked on the add profile section, clicked on the "core" button, and then hit the add skills button. 

![LinkidIn](3.png) 
I clicked on the SIEM button. 

![LinkidIn](4.png) 
I clicked where I use the skill which is in my Security Analyst internship.

![LinkidIn](5.png) 
I clicked save and clicked the far right exit button.

![LinkidIn](6.png) 
I clicked on the jobs button at the top nav bar which took me to the [job page](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/). Then clicked on one of my recent job searches.

![LinkidIn](7.png) 

It took me to that previous job search. I clicked on the of the listed jobs and hit apply. 

![LinkidIn](8.png) 
That took me to the [application website](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 |The site was generally very intuitive, no major issues and the layout was fine.    |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |3   |The site did not have unnecessary pages or popups that distracted from my tasks.    |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |3   |Everything is clearly labeled and stands out.   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |2   |This site lead me to where I wanted to go. I believe there are multiple ways to complete what I did, but I would have had to search for those other ways.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |3   |No long paragraphs of information. Kept things simple and precise   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |3   |Very easy to use and visible nav bar made navigation easy |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |2   |While I cannot have 100% certainty as I do not use those systems, the app seems to alt attributes for its pictures which would at least allow for a screen reader to work well. |
| **TOTAL** | 3  |Very intuitive and easy to use website   |

## 2.3 Site 2
### Captions and steps: 
![Handshake](9.png)
I already had a Handshake account before this lab. I googled handshake and clicked on the 2nd to last recommendation that popped up. 

![Handshake](10.png)
That link took me to my [inbox](https://app.joinhandshake.com/stu/conversations#334554864). It actually took me a while to figure out where my actual profile/skills section may be under as the username circle is small and is in the very far top right of the page. 

![Handshake](11.png)
After clicking my username circle I clicked My profile on the drop-down.

![Handshake](12.png)
That took me to my [Profile Page](https://app.joinhandshake.com/stu/users/25363308) 

![Handshake](13.png)
I scrolled down to find my skills. 

![Handshake](14.png)
I typed SIEM in the search bar and clicked add SIEM skill. 

![Handshake](15.png)
SIEM was then added to my skills. 

![Handshake](16.png)
I clicked on the Jobs part of the top nav bar and was taken [here](https://app.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings).


![Handshake](17.png) 
I scrolled down the right bar to find the Apply Externally button. 

![Handshake](18.png) 
Clicking the button created this popup which I could then use to attach/submit my resume and move to the external site. 

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1   |While the other aspects were fine, attempting to find my profile took me a lot longer then it really should have. I had to actively think and look for my profile page.    |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |3   |Aside from making me search for my profile page this site did not waste my time   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 1 | It did not make my profile page clear at all. The other steps were fine.    |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  |Yes, it very clearly and easily lead me to the jobs page.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3   |No issues with copy. No paragraph long buttons or anything that stood out.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |1  |Once again, my profile picture/name being such a small part and in such a distant part of the screen made it hard to navigate where I wanted. The other aspects of the nav bar are clear.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1   |Once again I do not know the in and outs of accessibility as I do not use those programs, however Handshake does not have alt attribute tags for screen readers. This makes it less accessible than LinkedIn.   |
| **TOTAL** | 1 | Bad, has promise and the clear ability to be a good website, but it has a few major drawbacks that make it more of a chore to use  |
